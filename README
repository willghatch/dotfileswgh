This git repository is for my personal configuration files.

In the root directory are common dotfiles that go in the home directory, some other add-ons (I keep stuff that works for both bash and zsh in bazsh_common, for example), and some directories which are generally analagous to $HOME/.dirname.

Many of them are only slightly modified from defaults.  Some are fairly heavily customized.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions let me know!

Be warned -- I do weird stuff and experiment with things a lot.  You may find things that you think are crazy.
