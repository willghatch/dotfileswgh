# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
menu_parent h Left
menu_child  l Right
menu_down   j Down
menu_up     k Up
menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
#next_img j Right space
#prev_img k Left BackSpace

next_img w Right space
prev_img b Left BackSpace

# and image movement
scroll_up    k C-Up
scroll_down  j C-Down
scroll_left  h C-Left
scroll_right l C-Right

# File deletion
#remove     d   Delete
#delete   C-d C-Delete

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames n
toggle_exif E

# zooming
zoom_in  C-Up e
zoom_out C-Down o
zoom_default F
zoom_fit f

# I only hit these accidentaly
save_image
save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
