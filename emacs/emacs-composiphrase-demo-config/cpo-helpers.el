;; macro stuff
;; TODO - after I decide what I want, rename and finalize things.

;; TODO - I want to have some kind of nested kmacro recording.  Eg. I want to be able to start recording a specific named macro, then start recording another specific named macro inside, finish the inner one and probably call it, then end the outer macro.  In part I want to use this because I want to have various commands that implicitly record named macros, mostly as an implementation detail, then allow calling them outside.
;;      - it looks like start-kbd-macro with an arg lets you start editing.  So If I keep state of a list of macro tags, and change behavior based on tag state, I can juggle multiple macro definitions.

;; TODO - not stuff to actually go in this file, but a checklist of things I want to replace evil-mode.  Note that many of these I can just fall back to requiring evil-mode and just using it...
;; * surround region - add delimiter
;; * surround - change delimiter, maybe
;; * . repeat, maybe, could just use macros more
;; * select register, maybe
;; * select object modifiers to get surrounding whitespace
;; * isearch land on start of search string -- actually I would like both, but with a way to control it.  Maybe this already exists?
;;
;; Differences from vim/evil to note:
;; * cursor always between characters
;; * movements are probably a bit different, not trying to slavishly copy vim, just get the spirit of my favorite features.  This isn't vim emulation, it's a start to replace evil-mode with something simpler that I can use as a springboard to broader exploration of better modal editing paradigms.
;; * copy doesn't leave visual mode (you can bind a key to do both, but by default it doesn't)
;; * delete doesn't copy (there is a copy/swap and a delete without copy).  Together with delete not copying, you can do copy-then-delete to get the same effect.
