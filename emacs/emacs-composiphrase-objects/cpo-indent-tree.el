;;; indent-tree.el --- TODO - description here -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Note that it will not work gracefully for improper trees (with
;; indentation levels skipped for some nodes).  This can only happen
;; for the first child of any node.
;; eg:
;;   root
;;      indented more than root's next child!
;;     normal child indentation
;;
;; Or more accurately, there can be an arbitrary number of “half-sibling” child
;; nodes for indentation (and org-mode) trees, where an early child is indented
;; more than a later half-sibling.  There can be half-sibling sets.
;; Eg:
;;   root
;;       4 deep
;;       4 deep again, full sibling to above
;;      3 deep, half sibling to above
;;       4 deep, child of 3 deep
;;      3 deep, full sibling to previous 3 deep
;;     2 deep, half sibling of both top 4 deep and both above 3 deep

By full-sibling region, I mean a region of full siblings that is delimited by half-sibling breaks.
For example, consider:

```
root
      r1a
      r1b
     r2a
     r2b
    r3a
    r3b

If point is on r1a or r1b, moving forward to the next full-sibling region would move to r2a.
If point is on r2a or r2b, moving backward to the next full-sibling region would move to r1a.

It always moves to the FIRST sibling in the full sibling region, regardless of motion direction.
