;; What operations do I want to support?
;; * next/prev sibling
;; * up to parent
;; * down to first child
;; * down to last child
;; * up to next/prev sibling of nearest ancestor that has one (IE for when I'm at a leaf node with no next sibling, to progress in an in-order-traversal I need to go up until I can go to next sibling)
;; * previous sibling's right-most bottom-most descendant
;; * in-order-traversal forwards/backwards
;; ** IE forwards is: down to first child if possible, else next sibling if possible, else up to first ancestor with a next sibling and then go to that next sibling.
;; ** Backwards is more complicated: if possible, go to the previous sibling's last child's last child etc recursively, if no previous sibling, go up.
;; * Maybe other traversal orders?  They might be interesting but seem less important.
;; * text objects on the trees, obviously
;; * slurp/barf operations if possible
;;
;; One of the biggest differences in trees I might like to support is whether or not they include an explicit end delimiter.
;; On trees with an explicit end delimiter, it can be really useful to go up to the end delimiter, but without an explicit end that operation doesn't really work -- eg. in an indentation tree where each line indents, the end of the (sub)tree is the end of each level of the subtree, so while it makes sense to go to the end point of any of those subtrees, it is ambigous if you want to go back.
;; This is also a problem for mixed trees, where if any of the trees mixed in lack explicit end delimiters, the mixed tree then doesn't universally have them.
;;
;; Another weird tree issue is the idea of “half-siblings” for indent trees and org/outline-mode trees.  These can both have a first child that is indented more than later children, and in fact can have an arbitrary number of early children that are indented deeper than later children.  Eg: * h1 **** h4 *** h3 ** h2.  Each of these may have valid sub-trees, but they are not full siblings despite sharing a parent.  So there should be a next/prev full-sibling function and a next/prev full-or-half-sibling function, and maybe a next/prev half-sibling region function, and the full inorder traversal function needs to use the full-or-half-sibling functions.  Also XML could have a definition where the attributes count as a set of half siblings -- not the main XML definition, but it could be an alternate mode.
;; But... does this cpo-tree-walk library need to care about full/half siblings?  The inorder traversal can just be given the next-full-or-half-sibling functions, and any specific trees with this quality can define their own helpers for dealing with full/half siblings.
;;
;; What are the common USEFUL operations that may be built on top of the basics, that I can bind to keys in a generic way so that once I learn the keys for operations and for trees I can compose them?
;; * Move to sibling is really useful for navigation and reading, eg. to get an overview of definitions at a certain level
;; * I delete to the end of the current s-exp.  That might be more complicated with generic trees to know exactly where to delete to for trees without an explicit end delimiter.
;; * highlight text objects -- with explicit delimiters there is a clear inner and outer object (inside and outside delimiter), without explicit delimiters the outer object is obvious, but they may have (possibly degenerate) inner objects as well
;; * slurp/barf -- sometimes I want to barf a single item out of multiple levels, but that's inconvenient.  I should add a barf operation where the cursor follows the barfee instead of the barfer.
;; * Down to last descendant is useful when navigating trees that don't have explicit delimiters to see where the end of a tree is, but it would be nice to be paired with an undo-move
;;
;; What kind of trees do I want to support (where effort allows)?
;; * Lisp (s-expressions)
;; * Org-mode/outline-mode hierarchies
;; * Lines with indentation
;; * Common data formats like JSON, XML
;; * Source code that can be parsed easily, eg. that has treesitter support
;; * Somewhere I had a list of a lot more, but I guess I didn't put them here.
;;
;; Starting key brainstorm:
;; Text object operations: <inner/outer-prefix><tree-object-key><tree-type>
;; Motion operations: <tree-prefix><motion-type><tree-type>
;; Doing the tree type last would allow for an alternate tree prefix for “last tree type” or “saved tree type” to have 2-key combos instead of 3-key.
;;
;; Non-motion operations:
;; * slurp -- forward turns neigbor sibling into last child, backward turns the previous sibling into the first child... but that makes more sense for s-expressions than eg. indent trees or org-mode.
;; * join -- splice current node with neighbor (forward or backward) -- for symex, basically delete two inner parens, for indent trees or org-mode it's close to joining lines.
;; * split -- add parens at point to split current symex into two, meaning it turns a single parent of a subtree into two siblings at the parent level.  So for org/indent it probably means inserting a header/indent at the parent level in the line above/below?
;; * splice -- IE delete parens for symex so each child becomes a sibling of where the parens were.  When at a paren it splices that paren, but when not on a paren it targets the parent parens.  For org-mode should this mean delete-this-level-and-promote-all-children?  Or promote this and all siblings?
;; * demote/wrap - opposite of splice, add parens, or add indent/header level.  Should this be demoting while adding a header above for org?  Org-mode has demotion without putting a header above, but that can make wonky trees, and indent trees have this problem even more.  Note that for symex or xml, surrounding requires a choice of which kind of paren or which tag.  Maybe there could be a default (eg. default to paren for lisp, to <TAG></TAG> or some TODO kind of form for xml), and then have another one that lets you select a paren/tag.
;; * maybe also demote-children, which leaves the current level in place but turns children into grandchildren of a new child?
;; * rewrap -- eg. change parent paren type, or xml tag type.  This doesn't exist for trees that don't have explicit delimiters.
;; * raise-sexp - IE replace parent tree with the current node
;; * transpose - IE swap sibling locations (with all siblings still with original parents).  Some have a difference between transpose and drag, basically where the cursor ends after.  IE for transpose forward does the cursor follow the thing that goes forward or stay in place?  I think moving (dragging) is generally more useful -- transpose twice without moving the cursor is a no-op, and dragging comes up more often than single transposition, I think.
;; * drag-backward-up - for symex, move current form to be first of siblings if not already, then hoist out of parent form (IE turn to sibling before parent paren), repeat.  For org-mode, it would turn the current heading to the first sibling of its parent, then become a sibling of the parent above it, similar for indent.
;; * drag-forward-down - not-quite-opposite of backward up, for symex become first child of the next paren.  For org-mode I guess it would be to become the first child of the next heading.  For indent tree, move below next line and dedent.  Many of these operations for indent trees would be useful if they could affect a range, IE a group of lines be dragged around together.
;; * drag-forward-up/drag-backward-down -- like the previous pair but with direction changed.
;; * convolute -- for symex, hoist parent and its children to point above grandparent.
;;   eg. (a b c (d e | f g)) -> (d e (a b c f g))
;;   So for org-mode it could mean to take the parent and any higher siblings and promote them, put them above grandparent and demote grandparent.  Similar for indent tree.
;; * delete forward/back -- eg. if point is at the start of a subtree kill it, putting the next subtree in its place.
;; * delete to parent -- IE in symex delete forward/backward to paren, in org-mode delete subtrees/siblings forward (IE until a non sibling) or backward until (but not including) parent
;; ** a modification of this is delete-to-parent-or-newline, which I find a little awkward.
;; * Ryan Culpepper wrote a cool sexp-rewrite package for matching and transforming trees, it's a cool idea that could be generalized, but would be a lot of work.
;; * new sibling forward/backward -- Eg. for indent tree or org-mode it opens a new line below/above the current element and indents it/bullets it appropriately.  My binding would probably also leave me in insert mode instead of normal/command mode.  For symex it can... well, maybe it can be context sensitive and open a new line when its in a list where each item starts on a new line, or it can move and add spaces to the correct place in a context where all is on one line.  But what to do when there is only one item in the list?  I mostly want this operation for org-mode and indent trees, less for symex.
;;
;; Movement and addressing:
;; * Movement operations should all move the cursor to some canonical anchor point.  This will probably typically be the beginning of the tree object, but could sometimes be elsewhere, eg. for infix trees the beginning of the infix operator is probably best.
;; * There should be a “thing at point” or similar function to get the bounds of the tree object at point.
;;
;;
;; TODO list
;; * Document things
;; * Make macro keywords consistent, and use names like def-X for symbols that the macro will define.
;; * Make it clear what APIs are necessary to define new cpo-tree-walk trees, and what APIs you get from it.
;; * Implement helper to get bounds for indent tree and similar trees -- convert it from being focused on evil-mode to focused on getting bounds more generally.
;; * Define a shared API for all trees to access bounds.  IE explicitly write some bounds helpers for smartparens, and decide if anything more is necessary.
;; * Define easy generic ops: transpose-sibling, transpose-sibling-region (IE transpose a group of siblings together, all of the siblings in the region (either strictly with the sibling regions exactly fitting the region or sloppily using all siblings that are partially in the region)), raise/replace-parent, etc.  Do I want things like delete forward/back, delete to parent, etc?  I think just having movements is enough for that -- IE move to start of first sibling, move to end of last sibling, etc paired with regions and deletion do it.
;; * Define additional motions -- IE in addition to the basic motions that go somewhere (hopefully to some canon anchor point) on the sibling/parent/child, define motions to go to specifically beginning/end of thing, also add idempotence option.
;; * Decide: what is necessary to have other generic ops, or how far can they be generic?  Eg. slurp/barf, join/split, splice, demote/wrap, rewrap, etc
;; * Define a full suite using smartparens as a base.
;; * Define a full suite using indent-tree as a base.
;; * Define a full suite using org-mode or outline-mode tree as a base.
;; * Define a full suite for treesitter
;; * Define a full suite for json
;; * Define a full suite for XML

Define INNER-NAME-bounds, OUTER-NAME-bounds as functions to get bounds of tree at point.

The inner object is a little wonky, it is roughly the children of the tree node, but what exactly that means depends on the tree type.
The outer object is the full tree node, and makes a lot more sense.

Both bounds functions return a region as a cons cell (beg . end) or nil.

The outer-bounds function takes an optional arguments: strictly-grow (bool), and region in (beg . end).
If strictly-grow is true, it only returns a region if it both strictly contains the old region (given or current) AND is strictly greater than it (IE extending it to the left or the right).
If no region is given, it uses the current region (or ((point) . (point))).
