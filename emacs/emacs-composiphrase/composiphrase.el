;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Composiphrase is a library for composing “command sentences”, and executing them.
;;; This is a similar idea to how the Vi and related text editors have a “composable editing language” with their key bindings.
;;; Except Composiphrase takes that idea more seriously.
;;; Composiphrase decouples the idea of composing elements of modifications to a command from the keys used to select words and execute sentences.
;;; Using composiphrase, in combination with a modal editing package like emacs-estate (which I wrote as a complement to composiphrase), you can create a text editing interface and language similar to Vim's.
;;; Or you can create a variety of other text editing interfaces / languages with varying degrees of composability.
;;; A complete demo editor with configuration can be seen at... TODO - I'm working on it!
;;;
;;; More concretely, composiphrase is just a simple matching library, where you write a configuration that defines verbs and objects (potentially each specifying default values for modifiers), and a big list of matchers.
;;; Matchers match on verb and object and modifiers.
;;; Matchers also specify whether and how any modifiers are passed as arguments to the matched function.
;;;
;;; By default there is no configuration -- your dreams (and, well, available time, talent, knowledge, energy, money, attention, lack of other priorities, etc) are the only limits!
;;; But there is also a demo configuration.
;;; But for now I promise no stability for the demo configuration!
;;;
;;; Details for writing a configuration:
;;; A composiphrase-sentence is a list of composiphrase-words.
;;; The `composiphrase-execute' function takes a composiphrase-sentence SENTENCE and a composiphrase-configuration CONFIG, and maps the sentence, using the config, to a specific function to call.
;;;
;;; A composiphrase-word is a dictionary imlemented as an alist, following a schema that maps a known set of keys to values.
;;; * word-type: can be 'verb, 'object, 'modifier
;;; * parameter-name: (only on 'modifier words) a symbol, name of appropriate parameter of object or verb
;;; * contents: for modifier it can be anything, for verb or object it should be a symbol
;;; * ui-hint: a string that can be displayed on the modeline or in some other way to show the current state (optional)
;;; * keys: a string or vector of the keys used when entering the word (optional)
;;;
;;; A composiphrase-configuration is an alist with the following top-level fields:
;;; * verbs - has a list of verb specifications
;;; * objects - has a list of object specifications
;;; * match-table - has a list of match-table specifications
;;;
;;; A verb specification is a list (VERB-NAME MODIFIER-SPEC ...)
;;; An object specification is a list (OBJECT-NAME MODIFIER-SPEC ...)
;;; A modifier spec is a list (PARAM-NAME DEFAULT-VALUE)
;;;
;;; A match-table specification is an list with the following fields:
;;; * verb: a symbol
;;; * object: a symbol
;;; * modifiers: an alist mapping modifier name to a list (VALUE OPTIONAL-COMPARATOR), if the optional comparator is not given, the `equal' function is used.  If `t` is given as the comparitor, the value always matches.  If a comparator function is given, it takes the given value first, then the table entry value.
;;; * executor: a list of function, then executor-argument-spec
;;;
;;; An executor-argument-spec is one of:
;;; * a list of parameter names in the order which they are to be given to the function
;;; * the symbol 'alist to pass all parameters in as an alist.
;;; * the symbol 'sentence-with-defaults to pass the the command sentence, but with default modifiers added.  This is useful to define verbs that are wrappers around others.
;;; * the symbol 'original-sentence to pass the original command sentence.
;;;
;;; Also, just go look at the demo configuration.
