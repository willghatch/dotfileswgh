These have thoughts about how to set up my keyboard shortcuts in a consistent and sensible manner.

* `windowkeys` has a well thought out scheme that I use for my window management/tmux/editors, and it frankly changed my life.  (Suddenly I knew all the windowing shortcuts in EVERY program I use that does windowing!)
* `pager-mode` has a set of keys I've used as standard for a paging mode in vim and emacs, but it's not particularly well thought out, it's just a map of what I decided to do since it's close to what I already was doing.
* `globalkeys` has some loose thoughts but no plans or good ideas.
