# Preserve intentional style choices

Don't change spacing after periods -- two spaces is intentional, but don't add them where absent.
Don't replace Unicode quotation marks (`""`, `«»`) or other Unicode characters with ASCII.
Never omit Oxford commas.
Don't move punctuation inside quotation marks; `“like this”.` is intentional.
