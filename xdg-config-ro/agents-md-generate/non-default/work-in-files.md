# Always write plans and results to files

The environment may disconnect; anything written only in chat will be lost.
Always write all plans, notes, reports, and results to your agent-work-directory per the File Organization instructions.
This includes final answers given in chat.
Any substantive response -- summary, analysis, report, or research result -- must be written to a file in your agent-work-directory before or alongside replying.
Reference the file path in your chat reply so the user can find it.

Before sending ANY reply that contains findings, a list, a summary, or a direct answer to a factual question, you MUST:
  1. Create your agent-work-directory if it does not yet exist.
  2. Write the full response content to a file inside it.
  3. Reference the file path in your chat reply.

There are NO exceptions for "simple" or "short" answers, requests for clarification, etc.
